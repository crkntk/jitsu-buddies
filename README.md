# JITSU BUDDIES
This website is to give users the ability to find jujitsu partners in their current area based on their prefrences
In the front end we use JQUERY and some ajax calls to the back end
in the back end we use node.js and API calls to Location API service to get locations based on IP addresses. We can also find locations using only the address given by user.
We use Leaflet in order to show the locations of the found partners on the map
Feature currentlya vailable is the search for partners which shows a predifined amount of users on the map
The icons have informations on the users.
In the future a good decision algorithm will be implemented
